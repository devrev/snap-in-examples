# Codelab: Automation as a Service (AdaaS)

## Overview
This Codelab outlines a placeholder for an "Automation as a Service" (AdaaS) Snap-in. The `15-adaas/code` directory for this example is currently empty and pending implementation.

This document serves as a template for what the Codelab will look like once the example is built.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and `npm` installed.
- A DevRev account.
- The DevRev CLI installed and configured.

## Future Implementation
The AdaaS Snap-in will provide a framework for creating and managing automations as reusable services. The implementation details are yet to be defined.

- **TODO**: Implement the core functions for the AdaaS Snap-in.
- **TODO**: Define the necessary `manifest.yaml` to support the AdaaS features.

## Manifest (Placeholder)
A manifest file will be required to define the Snap-in's properties, functions, and any other necessary configurations.

- **TODO**: Create the `manifest.yaml` file in the `15-adaas/` directory.

## Getting Started from Scratch
To build this Snap-in from scratch, follow these steps:

1.  **Initialize Project**:
    - **TODO**: Use the `devrev snaps init` command to scaffold a new Snap-in project structure in the `15-adaas/` directory.

2.  **Update Manifest**:
    - **TODO**: Create and define the `manifest.yaml` for the AdaaS Snap-in.

3.  **Implement Function**:
    - **TODO**: Write the core logic for the AdaaS functions in the `code/src/functions/` directory.

4.  **Test Locally**:
    - **TODO**: Create test fixtures and use `npm run start:watch` to verify the implementation.
