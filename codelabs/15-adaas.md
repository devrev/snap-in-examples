# Codelab: Automation as a Service (AdaaS)

## Overview
This Codelab outlines a placeholder for an "Automation as a Service" (AdaaS) Snap-in. The `15-adaas/code` directory for this example is currently empty and pending implementation.

This document serves as a template for what the Codelab will look like once the example is built.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and `npm` installed.
- A DevRev account.
- The DevRev CLI installed and configured.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setup
This section guides you on setting up a new Snap-in project from scratch.

#### Initializing a New Project
To create a new Snap-in, you'll use the DevRev CLI.

1.  **Initialize the project:** Run `devrev snap_in_version init <project_name>` to create a new project directory with a template structure. *(Reference: `init` documentation)*
2.  **Validate the manifest:** Before writing code, check the template `manifest.yaml` by running `devrev snap_in_version validate-manifest manifest.yaml`. *(Reference: `validate-manifest` documentation)*
3.  **Prepare test data:** Create a JSON file in `code/src/fixtures/` with a sample event payload for local testing.

### 2. Code
- **TODO**: Implement the core functions for the AdaaS Snap-in in the `code/src/functions` directory.

### 3. Run
- **TODO**: Implement local testing procedures.

### 4. Verify
- **TODO**: Define verification steps for the implemented features.

## Manifest
- **TODO**: Create the `manifest.yaml` file in the `15-adaas/` directory and define the Snap-in's properties, functions, and other configurations.

## Explanation
- **TODO**: Provide an explanation of the AdaaS Snap-in's functionality once implemented.
