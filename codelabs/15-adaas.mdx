> **Note:** This Codelab is a placeholder. The associated snap-in and its code are pending implementation. The content below serves as a template for what the Codelab will look like once the example is built.

## Overview

This document outlines a future "Automation as a Service" (AdaaS) snap-in. The `15-adaas/code` directory for this example is currently empty.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and `npm` installed.
- A DevRev account.
- The DevRev CLI installed and configured.

## Setup

This section describes the general steps for setting up a new snap-in project.

### Initializing a New Project
To create a new snap-in, you would use the DevRev CLI.

1.  **Initialize the project:** Run `devrev snap_in_version init <project_name>` to create a new project directory with a template structure.
2.  **Validate the manifest:** Once the manifest is created, check it by running `devrev snap_in_version validate-manifest manifest.yaml`.
3.  **Prepare test data:** For local testing, you would create a JSON file in `code/src/fixtures/` with a sample event payload.

## Manifest

A `manifest.yaml` file will be created in the `15-adaas/` directory to define the snap-in's properties, functions, and other configurations.

## Code

The core functions for the AdaaS snap-in will be implemented in the `code/src/functions` directory.

## Run

Local testing procedures will be defined here once the snap-in is implemented.

## Verify

Verification steps for the implemented features will be added to this section.

## Explanation

An explanation of the AdaaS snap-in's functionality will be provided once it is implemented.
