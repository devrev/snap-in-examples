# Random Number Generator Snap-In PRD

## Overview
The Random Number Generator snap-in automatically adds a comment containing a random number when a new ticket is created in the system.

## Goals
- Automate the process of adding a random number to new tickets
- Provide a consistent format for random number comments
- Ensure reliable execution when tickets are created

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. The snap-in shall trigger automatically when a new ticket is created
2. The snap-in shall generate a random number between 1 and 1000000
3. The snap-in shall create a new comment on the ticket containing the generated number
4. The comment format shall be: "Random Number: [generated_number]"
5. The snap-in shall execute before any other automated processes on the ticket

### Technical Requirements
1. Integration with ticket creation webhook/event system
2. Secure random number generation
3. Error handling for failed comment creation
4. Performance impact of less than 500ms on ticket creation
5. Logging of snap-in execution and any errors

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. 99.9% uptime for the snap-in
2. Maximum response time of 1 second
3. Ability to handle up to 1000 ticket creations per minute

## Success Metrics
- Successful random number generation and comment creation for 99.9% of new tickets
- No impact on ticket creation performance
- No duplicate random number comments

## Limitations and Constraints
- Random numbers limited to positive integers
- One random number comment per ticket
- No modification of existing random number comments

## Security Considerations
- Ensure random number generation is cryptographically secure if required
- Verify proper access permissions for comment creation

## Future Enhancements
- Configurable range for random numbers
- Custom comment format templates
- Option to generate multiple random numbers
- Support for different number formats (decimal, hexadecimal, etc.)
